# My Story
I started gamedevelopment and programming when I was 10, after watching the tutorial "[BR] Crie Ser Próprio Jogo Guselect Gamemaker". Since then, I've made a bunch of gamejam games, and created a major project, Farmbotany. This branched off into me learning a bunch of things, like Python, Pygame, a little bit of Rust, Git and much else.

# Skills
I know a lot of Python and Pygame, a little bit of Rust, the essential of Git (add, commit, push), video editing (Kdenlive) and drawing (Aseprite, Krita)

That's it! Don't take none of this seriously, by the way, this is all just a hobby
